# RAMSAFE File Fuzzy Hash Comparison Tool
#
# This script compares two local files using ssdeep fuzzy hashing to determine
# similarity. Fuzzy hashing allows detection of similar files even if they
# have been slightly modified (unlike traditional cryptographic hashes).
#
# AUTHOR: RAMSAFE Project Team
# PURPOSE: Compare similarity between two files for forensic analysis
# USAGE: ./ssdeep_compare_files.sh <file1> <file2>
# OUTPUT: Similarity score (0-100, where 100 = identical files)
#
# FORENSIC USE CASES:
# - Detect modified versions of known CSAM files
# - Compare evidence files for similarity analysis  
# - Identify files that may be related despite different hashes
#
# IMPORTANT: A similarity score does NOT guarantee files are related.
# All matches should be manually examined for verification.
#

# Ensure exactly two arguments are provided
